# Advanced exercise 

 - Create the five lists from the given task as a basis for processing. 

  - Using the answer from 6) and the Inventory list, create an algorithm that recognizes the newly added item(s) in the Inventory list and assigns it to one of the four categories: IT/Auto/Health/Game Product, and adds it to the respective list. 
  - For all four lists, create a method that notifies the user when an item exists twice in the lists, and create an algorithm that finds the duplicate items by product name and determines their index, then calculates the total number of products with the exact name and inserts a new item in the respective list with the following format:  

`< (Updated Count) "Item Name" (Range) >` 

 

After creating this method, run it at exactly 00:00:00 every day using a Date Time Import.  
__This does not make much sense. To be able to run it on a timer you would have to create a cron job to run the paython script in the computer at 00:00:00 every day__
  

- Create a "GUI" for the program that considers the following options and runs the program. 

1 - Add an item to the inventory. 

2 - Express all available items that are in the desired list. 

3 - Run the duplicate check method. 

4 - Exit (quits the program).
